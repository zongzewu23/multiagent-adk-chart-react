Directory Organization

/tools/ - Contains the SalesTrendAnalyzer.py tool file that should be analyzed to understand data structures and available metrics
/sample-frontend/ - Contains the sample dashboard code provided by Claude to use as reference
/frontend/ - This is where the actual implementation should be created

Implementation Requirements

Read and analyze the Python tool from the /tools/ directory
Study the sample code in /sample-frontend/ but improve upon it
Create a complete React dashboard implementation in the /frontend/ directory
Generate synthetic data that matches the structure expected by SalesTrendAnalyzer
Implement dark/light mode toggle while maintaining futuristic UI aesthetics
Create all interactive components following React best practices


All finished code should be implemented exclusively in the /frontend/ directory.
